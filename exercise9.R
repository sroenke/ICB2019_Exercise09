#Note: 50 Dictatorships were found in total, however, 7 were removed due to a lack of data (i.e. North Korea) and one additional one was removed, Bahrain, because it was a drastic outlier, having a very high population density; Bahrain is in fact the #8 densest population worldwide at about 2,000people/sq.km)

#The bar plot makes the populations all look very similar, 
#whereas the scatter plot shows that they each have unique behavior, 
#with the east having kind of a bell shape curve,
#the north having a single tight cluster,
#the south having a tight cluster and a loose cluster,
#and the west having a uniform distribution.
